Load the DataFrame from the core pandas module.
```python
from pandas import DataFrame
```

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3], 'b':[4,5,6], 'c':[7,8,9]})
```

```R
df <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,3), b=c(4,5,6), c=c(7,8,9))
```

Column access
-------------
Python doesn't know about two-dimensional indexing, so indexing rows and
columns must conform to Python semantics. The default indexing in pandas 
extracts columns.

```
In [12]: df['b']
Out[12]: 
0    4
1    5
2    6
Name: b, dtype: int64
```

R supports two-dimensional indexing, so column access is specified using
the second element of the indexing operator.
```R
> df[,'b']
```


Get some columns
In [13]: df[['a','b']]
Out[13]: 
   a  b
0  1  4
1  2  5
2  3  6


> df[,c('a','b')]


Integer indexing
----------------
To access a column by index requires calling a method.

```python
df.
```

However, if your object is a numpy array, then you can use an index,
but be aware that the indices are for rows.

```R
df[,2]
```

Union
-----
Suppose you have two data frames with the same column structure. 
Combining the rows into a single data frame is known as a union in
SQL parlance. In R, the `rbind` command accomplishes the same thing.

```R
df2 <- data.frame(a=4:6, b=7:9, c=10:12)
rbind(df,df2)
```

```python
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'a':range(4,7), 'b':range(7,10), 'c':range(10,13)})
pd.concat([df,df2])
```


Logical indexing
----------------
On a DataFrame, logical indexing operates on rows.

In R, you choose the axis to apply the index based on the indexing operator
syntax.


Inspecting
==========
In R, the `head` and `tail` functions work on all core data structures.

In Python, `head` is a method on certain data structures, such as DataFrame
and Series. For other iterables you need to use basic slice notation.
