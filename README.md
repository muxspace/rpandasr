Death by Pandas
===============

An interoperability guide between pandas, numpy, et al. and R

With the boom in data science, everyone needs to know how to use pandas
and also R. While pandas mimics many aspects of R, there are a lot of
syntactic deviations. To avoid unnecessary head scratching, this guide
illustrates common idioms in both pandas and R.

As a veteran R user, this guide is written from the perspective of
an R user that needs to become proficient in pandas. An ancillary
goal is to help data scientists transition from pandas/numpy to R
by demonstrating the consistency and efficiency of R.

This is a work-in-progress.
