## Concatenate vectors
Python overloads operators so that `+` means concatenate for
lists.
```python
x = [1]
y = [2,3]
x + y
```
You can also do `x.extend(y)`. However, this changes `x`in place. 
Hence your reference needs to stick around, which means it won't
work for literal lists (e.g. `[1].extend([2,3])` returns None).

```R
x <- 1
y <- c(2,3)
c(x,y)
```

Scalar with vector
```python
np.append(np.array(x), y)
```

```R
c(x, y)
```

Repeat a value
```python
In [36]: np.repeat(1,4)
Out[36]: array([1, 1, 1, 1])
```

```python
In [34]: np.repeat([1,2,3], 3)
Out[34]: array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])
```

```R
> rep(1,4)
[1] 1 1 1 1
```

```R
> rep(1:3, 3)
[1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
```

Last element of a vector
x[-1]

Last n elements of a vector

x = range(0,10)
In [3]: x[-3:]
Out[3]: [7, 8, 9]

> tail(x,3)


All but the last n elements of a vector
In [4]: x[:-3]
Out[4]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
